			<h1>About JHR</h1>
			<p>At JHR Environmental Testing (JHR), we dedicate most of our time  to performing lead paint inspections, risk assessments and the subsequent clearance inspections on inner-city residential properties. The company was founded in Worcester in 1989. JHR is now based in Newton with a site office in Foxboro.</p>

			<p>During our 23 years in operation, JHR has performed over 35,000 inspections, which include initial inspections, risk assessments, reinspections, and post-compliance assessments. The compliance and risk assessment process also requires us to sample for lead in dust and soil. We use RMD-LPA-1’s for determining how much lead is in paint, and when outside analysis is required for testing of dust, soil or paint chips we use federal and state certified laboratories.</p>

			<p>The bulk of our work comes from inner-city small property owners who own three to six rental units. We also work with cities, community development corporations, and redevelopment agencies that are grantees or sub-grantees of HUD’s Lead Hazard Reduction and Demonstration grants.</p>

			<p>Property management companies who manage thousands of units constitute about 25% of our work. The vast majority of these properties are in the Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan neighborhoods; most properties are defined by HUD as being either project or tenant based, and as such must comply with Title X. In addition, we do consulting work with national property management companies, implementing their O&M policies & procedures pursuant to both HUD and EPA guidelines. We also produce Ongoing Maintenance Schedules as required under the Title X Lead Safe Housing Rule.</p>
